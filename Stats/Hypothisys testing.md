# Hypotheses test  

## When do we want to use one 
 - we use a hypothisys test when we want to make a claim about an entire population form a smaple 

## 1 make claim
 - we want to see if our drug has an effect on blood pressure 
 - our claim: the drug has an effect on blood pressure

## 2 population and sample
 - population and sample we cant get the entire population so we will get sample 
 - we will then use this sample for the population 

## 3 hypothesis test
 - now we are going to test the claim from step 1 using data in our sample 
 - then we can make our null and our alt hypothsys 
 - null: this is what is held to be true 
 - alt: what we want to prove 

## 4 find p value
 - null says that there is no diffrence
 - then we calculate how much the sample deveates from the null hypothesis
 - the p value calculates the probibility of getting a sample that deveates as much as the sample or one that deveates more than the sample asumming null is true 


## 5 signifance
**what is a p value**

 - a p value is a value that says how likley we are to get a sample that deveates from the null hypothsys or one that deveates more by random chance 
 - low p value means that if the null hypothsys is true then we are likley to get a result like the one we saw or one that deveates even more 

**signifance**

 - if our p value is less than our predetermined threshold then the result is considered significant 
 - low p value means that the result was not genreated by random chance 
 - if we have a low enough p value then we can reject the null
  
| **P-Value Range**      | **What It Means**                              | **What to Do**                     | **Conclusion**                        |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| \( P > 0.10 \)          | Weak evidence; data supports \(H_0\).         | Do not reject \(H_0\).             | No strong proof against \(H_0\).      |
| \( 0.05 < P <= 0.10 \)| Some evidence against \(H_0\).                | Usually do not reject \(H_0\).     | Data is unclear; more info needed.    |
| \( 0.01 < P <= 0.05 \)| Strong evidence against \(H_0\).              | Reject \(H_0\).                    | Likely proof for \(H_a\).             |
| \( P <= 0.01 \)       | Very strong evidence against \(H_0\).         | Reject \(H_0\).                    | Very likely proof for \(H_a\).        |


## 6 error 
 - error we can have 2 types of error one where the sample is so far off even if the null is true 
 - or we can have a sample that is so close to the mean even if the null is true
