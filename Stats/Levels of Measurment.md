# intro
- we are going to be taking a closer look at inferential stats and finding whish hyp test to pick
- the hyp test we pick is determined by the levels of mesurment in our data
- there are 4 levels of mesurement: Nominal Ordinal Interval and Ratio
- they will hopfully be explained later

**what are levels of mesurement**
- levels of mesurement are diffrent ways that varables can be catagorized  
- often times interval and ratio are require the same type of analysis so they are grouped together and are called metric 

**why do we need levels of mesurments**
- basically its the rules for how our data can be interperted
- knowing how to interpert our data will give us more insight into what hyp test and dataviz we should use
- ex -> bar charts are good for nominal data and hist is better for metric data
- as good practice always think about what type of test you want to do BEFORE you collect your data because if you go and collect your data and choose you want to do a test that you cant do on then youre boned

# nominal varables
- nominal is the easiest form of mesurement 
- ex -> gender with catagorys(male|female)
- ex -> types of animals(dog|cat|bird) 
- nominal varables cant be ranked 
- bar charts are good for this data

# ordnal data
- this is data that can be ranked but their ranks dont have a mathmatical meaning
- ex -> rankings like (1st|2nd|3rd)
- ex -> satisfaction ratings(happy|sad|content)

# metric data
- numbers baby!!!!
- we have 2 types of metric data 
- interval and ratio
- ratio means that the data starts from 0 and comparisons like double or half are meaningful
