## intro to ANOVA 
 - anova stands for Analysis of Varance
 - there are diffrent types analysis of varance


## why do we need ANOVA?
 - anova tests wether there are stastically significant diffrences between 3 or more groups
 - its like the t-test but for more than 2 groups
 - remember if there are 2 groups we use a independent t-test

## how to do an ANOVA test
 - ex -> lets say the owner of dataTab(stats website) wants to see the diffrence in age with somone who uses dataTab, sps, or R
 - to do this we could take a survay of somone, what tool they use, and how old they are.
 - so what are we actually going to answer with ANOVA? 
 - research question: is there a diffrence in the population between the diffrent groups of the independent varable with respect to the dependant varable 
 - our independent varables will be the software dataTab, sps, and R
 - our dependent varable is what is mesured so in this case age 
 ## hypothisys
 - null: there is no diffrence in the means of the ages for the individual groups
 - alt: at least 2 means are diffrent from eachother
 ## another example 
 - lets say that you wanted to find the salary between 3 groups 
 - we plot them and look at it thats it!
